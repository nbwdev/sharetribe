        We instantly think about sunglasses and sunscreen whenever the sun is out but do you ever think you might be missing something else important?
        Any exposure to the sun can cause some short-term damage but if you are not careful during prolonged exposure, it can turn into long-term damage and ageing too.

      %p
        Summer hats are now becoming more and more important as a vital piece of protection for your head and delicate face area,
        especially in increased heat on holiday, but many are still regarding it as an after-thought or something to be avoided completely.
        Do you leave it as a last-minute thing or do you avoid sun hats altogether?
        Why is a summer hat always such an afterthought for most people or even an absolute no-go area for others?

      %p
        Do you feel confident enough to wear your hat or not?
        If you don’t then there is no need to panic or give up looking for your perfect summer hat just yet.
        So, before you give up on choosing altogether, lets take a look at how to fix that.

        Summer hats - finding the right amount of sun protection

        Buying a hat for sun protection is always a slightly different matter to buying one simply to compliment your summer wardrobe.
        The perfect summer hat can offer you the right amount of protection and instantly take your wardrobe up a level if you choose the right one.
        But chose the wrong hat and you could end up looking more flustered in the hot sun than looking summer cool.
        A bad holiday hat can leave you with little or no protection at all and be a real flop at the beach altogether.
        Some hats can leave you thinking you are fully UV protected, when you are actually not.

      %p
        If you are looking for a hat with the right amount of protection for you, then it’s a good idea to think about investing in a good quality summer hat from the start.
        As a general rule the more cover you need on your body, the bigger the hat brim should be. 

      %h3
        Key areas to cover

      %p
        The main thing to consider is how much cover and protection you need.
        There are four main grouped areas that usually require cover and protection.
        These are your head, your face and ears, your neck, and your shoulders and lower back.
        You should also be receiving even and ample coverage in all areas from any good hat.

      %p
        If you just looking for protection on your face and neck then you can probably look at something with a much smaller brim,
        but if you need to cover your shoulder and upper back, then you may need a much wider circumference of shade and therefore a much bigger hat brim.
        There should be absolutely no sun getting through your hat to your head, face and ears, neck, shoulders, or upper back either.

        There are four main categories that you should consider when choosing a hat for sun protection.
        The main things to consider are the fit of the head cover, the circumference of shade, the material and weave, and UV protection.

      %h3
        Head cover
      %p
        How your hat fits is very important. The right hat with the right fit should be working with you, not against you.
        It should fit comfortably on your head and at your desired angle.
        It should not be too tight or too loose and you should be able to wear it all day without any trouble.
        If you find yourself messing about with it all day, then it is not the right hat for you.
        You are more likely to give up wearing it altogether and lose your protection if it feels uncomfortable and constantly needs adjusting. 

      %h3
        Circumference of shade

      %p
        To ensure you have optimum protection the brim of your hat should block out the sun completely, and let no light pass through its material.
        The right size brim will also cast the right amount of shade on the areas that you most want to protect from the sun.
        As a general rule the circumference of shade should extend to incorporate the area in need of coverage.
        So, if you want to cover just your face, ears and neck in shade then you may only need a small to medium size brim,
        but if you need to cover your shoulders and lower back as well, then you will need a larger brim that expands outwards past your shoulder width.

      %h3 
        Material and weave

      %p
        One of the important factors to consider when choosing a good summer hat is the material.
        The amount of protection you receive is dependent on the type of material and the quality of the fabric you choose. 
        Generally, the weather is likely to be much hotter when you go away, so the material needs to be of a tightly woven fabric for optimum protection from the stronger rays.
        The material should be light enough to keep you cool but thick enough to keep you protected, so you might want to reconsider anything made of wool or felt.
        A good option is a good strong straw hat or a heavy-duty cotton one, which can be easy to pack and take away on holiday.
        A breathable fabric is also important so you don't overheat in the hotter sun.  

      %h3
        UV Protection

      %p
        Hats have come a long way in the past few years and some even carry a protection rating similar to sunscreen.
        The rating is referred to as UPF and is generally used on clothes, but will help you pick the right hat with the desired amount of protection for your needs.
        UPF50+ is a good level to look for.

      %p
        I recently visited a popular tourist attraction on a nice sunny day and had a look at all the types of hats people were wearing.
        There was quite a selection, so I have taken the top 8 most popular hats that I saw and provided details on their average coverage.
        I rated them all for quality of coverage and gave them a score out of 10.
        But remember these are a guide and it is important to do some more research to determine what is going to work for you and your individual protection needs.
        I found the best way is to physically go and try them all on, to see what you really think.

        Wearing a hat does not need to be daunting or a style killer, no matter where you wear it.
        Remember, the sun hat is there to add something extra to your outfit and your needs.
        It has a purpose and once you determine its full purpose you can start trying the right ones on and ultimately pick the best one for you.
        The one that you end up liking the most will be the one that you feel most comfortable wearing and the most protected.
        This will be that one that is the right one for you.
        Once you find your one true hat, you will be brimming with confidence in no time and will feel protected no matter what the weather, where you go and what you do this summer.
        
      %p
        So go be that stylish lady you just saw wearing that great hat and enjoy wearing it until the sun goes down.
