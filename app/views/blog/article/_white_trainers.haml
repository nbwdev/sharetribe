        If you own a pair of white trainers you might be wondering if they are still in fashion. 

      %p
        There is something great about wearing a pair of these perfectly clean white trainers, but has their time run out?

      %h3
        Are people still wearing white trainers?

      %p
        What is it that feels so great about owning a perfect pair of white trainers?
        If you own a pair can you say?
        I knew something was different the moment I bought a pair.
        I knew I had made the right choice.
        We have secretly fallen in love with them, but why?

      %p
        I recently stopped a couple of people in the street and asked them why they wore white trainers and here is what they both said.

      %p
        Answer 1 — “They always look good and they go with everything I wear”

      %p
        Answer 2 — “I always feel good wearing them”

      %p
        We have also become more of a smart/casual world now and maybe these trainers fit right in with that.

      %p
        Overall I got the general feeling that wearing white trainers was definitely still in and that it really worked for the people I talked to,
        but has their time run out?

      %p
        Here are the top 6 reasons why people are still wearing white trainers:

        White trainers in general have been around for decades and have always had a positive vibe about them.
        You only need to mention tennis and everyone knows that effortless look I am talking about.

      %p
        So, I don’t think they have ever been out of fashion, it’s just been ramped up a bit recently.
        The other day I sat outside a café and watched how many people went past in white trainers and honestly, there were tonnes.

        Maybe it’s this positive and active vibe that we like that has spilled out onto the high street.
        There is possibly another reason why we have grown to love them so much.
        They are easy to deal with.
        You just have to keep them clean.
        They will always match and they will always look good.
        They are just less hassle and one less thing to think or worry about right now, as long as you keep them clean.
        They are 100% reliable.
        I don’t think it matters what style you choose either.
        They just work.

        I recently went on holiday and took only two pairs of shoes with me.
        Yes, you read that right.
        I went away for 7 days and took only two pairs of shoes in my luggage.
        It was more of an experiment really.
        My theory was that if white trainers really do go with everything then technically all I needed was one pair, right?
        I wanted to see what happened to my luggage if had only one type of footwear with me.

      %p
        Would I end up taking less luggage?
        Would I have enough shoes?
        Well the answer is yes to both!
        I wore my white trainers with everything.
        It made getting ready less hassle and much easier in the heat, and I always felt well dressed day or night.
        So, I will still be wearing my white trainers all summer, day or night, and I can highly recommend them on holiday for less hassle too.

      %p
        Just in case you wondered, my second pair of shoes were flip flops.

      %h3 
        Less was definitely more

      %p
        My white trainers became the key to packing less for my holiday.
        They also saved me a lot of time when getting ready.
        I think I spent less time deciding what to wear and more time at the beach because of that. 

      %p
        Here is how I generally wore them on holiday and how long it took me to choose my outfit.

        If you own a pair have you ever noticed how you feel when you look down and see those bright white trainers looking so nice and clean?
        I don’t know about you, but I feel just lovely.
        I feel I am well dressed and I feel I am good to go.
        It is always the case no matter what I am doing, but that is not all. 

      %p
        There is something uplifting that happens when you step outside wearing a pair of crisp white trainers
        and a few people have mentioned it.

      %p
        There is, however, one other lovely aspect to these white beauties.
        Money!
        If they work so well with everything in your wardrobe, then surely they are a good investment.
        If you only need one pair, then again a really good investment, right?
        It’s all about looking your best and feeling your best.
        I wonder if white trainers could be the perfect footwear for a date?
        Are white trainers bringing more into our lives than we think?
        What would happen if we suddenly gave all that up?

        Are you ready to give up your white trainers? 

      %p
        It’s time to ask the important questions.
        If you own a pair of white trainers, do they bring joy into your life?
        Are they great to wear and are they easy to match to your wardrobe?
        Do you feel ready to give all that up now?
        Do you know what you would wear instead?
        Would the change bring you the better joy?

      %p
        After my little holiday experiment I did some further digging and it turns out that 1 in 5 trainers bought globally are still white,
        and we spend around $15 billion on them around the world.
        My advice is to wear your white trainers all summer if you want to.
        You won't be on your own.
        Wear them all day and all night if they work for you because honestly they still look great.
        So if you still love them, then wear them.
