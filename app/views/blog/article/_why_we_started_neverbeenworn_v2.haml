    %h3 Why do we want to help?
    %p
      We all have clothes in our wardrobe that we just never got around to wearing and we simply no longer need.
      We know they take up too much room and we know we can’t bring ourselves to get rid of them just yet.
      Why? Because these are great clothes and we still hope maybe we will wear them just once.
      The sad thing is, we know this might never happen, so we are stuck and there is no more room.
      Well great news ladies. We want to help you out with that.

    %h3 Sustainability, why?
    %p
      By finding a new home for your unworn items you will also be doing your human bit to help the planet
      and help make a change for the better.
      You will be encouraging ladies to buy neverbeenworn items which will help sustainable fashion grow.
      You will be sending your items back out into the world to be re-sold and re-loved with a chance to be worn
      instead of them sitting at home in your wardrobe taking up all of that valuable space that could be filled with
      something you really need and want.
      You will be helping to encourage the world to stop taking more from the planet to make more and
      to stop creating more waste. 

    %h3 We are humans….
    %p
      We are not scientists, we are not world leaders.
      We are humans and we wanted to make a human change, so this is why we started Neverbeenworn.
      We hope that with your help, our little human change could one day become a big human change,
      but right now we hope it makes your life a little easier in a nice human way.

%h3 A new beginning….
%p
  At neverbeenworn, we say yes to new beginnings and yes to new directions.
  We say yes to doing our human bit to helping the planet and helping to create a better world.
  We say yes to healthy respectful humans and yes to a sustainable, fulfilling and happy life.
