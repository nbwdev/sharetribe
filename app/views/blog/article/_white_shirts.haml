        Fabric and fit are the make or break of how your white shirt will look on you.
        If you have bought a shirt once or twice before, do you remember how it fitted you?
        Do you remember what the fabric was like? Do you remember if you had to re-adjust it often?

      %p
        The key to finding the perfect white shirt is also finding the right fabric, fit and finally the right shape for you.
        The perfect fabric is the best quality you can afford and it should not be see-through. So do check this.
        The fabric is made for longevity so it will remain looking good for longer. The perfect fit is going to move with you and not against you.
        This is how you achieve that effortless look.

      %p
        There is no point spending your money on a shirt that is too tight or too loose or that you are constantly readjusting and messing about with all the time.
        This is not the way to get that effortless look.

      %p
        Effortless is all about comfort.

      %p
        You want the fit to match the type of comfort you expect from wearing your shirt.
        Having clothes that fit you in all the right ways and in all the right places in the way that they should, is the key to the effortless look.

      %p
        There are no restrictions on fabric type, but it is probably a good idea to really be honest and think about your comfort level and desired style.
        There are also some great blended and mixed fabrics available which can give a few more available options and styles and a higher level of comfort.
        Not every retailer has the same sizing guide and measurements though.
        So, it is also a good idea to try on a few different brands and get a good feel for their size guides and true fit.
        Your perfect size may not be your current favourite brand. So do check a few others out as well.

      %p
        There are many types of details and many different types of finishes available to choose from for your white shirt.
        These range from various button down styles, detailed cuffs and different collar types to final stitching and finishes.
        What details you choose and prefer on your shirt is entirely up to your own taste, preferences and occasion.

      %p
        If you have a preference for interesting detail, then keep it that way, as detail.
        Over-styling or choosing a trend based design on a white shirt can shorten its shelf life as it may go out of style as quickly as it came in.
        You are more likely to get bored of it sooner than you think and so it won’t be part of your main wardrobe for very long, so choose wisely and for the long game.

      %p
        A white shirt is a classic item, it does not date or go out of fashion because it remains stylish and understated and therefore it does not age.
        What does that mean?
        Well it means it will always look good and it can therefore be relied upon at any moment and for any event or occasion.
        Remember, a white shirt is there to support you and your wardrobe and your life, as a pillar or staple item and it’s supposed to be there for you for the long game.

      %p
        The way to look at cost is to think about how long you would like the shirt to last and what you consider affordable to you.
        Setting a ceiling price might be the best option, especially if you are managing other costs in your life too.
        Think about the lowest price you would like your shirt to cost and the top price you think you should sensibly pay for good quality.
        Next think of the brands you are most likely to look at and buy from that fit these category. 

      %p
        Try a new brand that you might not have thought of before, just to see what their sizing guide and fit it like.
        You never know, you might be surprised and find just what you were looking for. 

      %p
        Once you think you have found your perfect shirt you want it to last and be a part of your wardrobe for as long as possible.
        So taking care of your shirt is a big part of making this happen, so checking the washing instructions before you make your purchase is a good idea.
        Make sure you can handle the caring, washing and ironing guidelines.
        There is no point buying a shirt that needs dry cleaning or hand washing after each use,
        if your budget or schedule does not allow for regular trips to the dry cleaners, or you don’t have the time or inclination to do a regular hand wash.
        There is just no point, so check the label carefully and be sure you can care for your shirt.
        If you can keep it looking good in your wardrobe, it will always look good when you put it on.

      %p
        If you consider all the points above carefully then you are more likely to get it right and if you get it right, your white shirt is more likely to become a staple item in your wardrobe.
        If you own more staple items in your wardrobe them you have more items that work for you and that you can finally rely on.
        Getting ready just become a whole lot easier.
        This is where you really start to save time and look effortlessly amazing every time and this, ladies, is how it’s done.
