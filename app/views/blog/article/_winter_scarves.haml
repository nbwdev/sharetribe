        Buying a winter scarf does not have to be complicated and letting an old one go does not have to be traumatic either.
        Yes, there are several things you should think about, but it’s not that hard to work through them, and by the end of this article you should feel more confident about knowing exactly what to look for.
        If you haven’t put much thought into your scarf-buying process then the basics of
        %span.strong
          buying a good scarf
        is the right place to start.
        It could save you from making a bad purchase as well as saving you time and money.
        So, let’s get started.

        1. Key features: how we bond with scarves

      %p
        Let’s start by thinking about your last scarf.
        If you still have it but want to replace it, then try to identify what it is that you liked about it most.
        Was it that it was affordable, was it that it was trendy, or maybe it was a well made winter scarf?
        Maybe it was it a nice cozy scarf, or a good chunky knit or even a nice long winter one?
        Most scarves that go the distance in anyone’s winter wardrobe have a favourite thing about them.
        A much-loved feature that bonded you to your scarf by at least the second or third trip out.
        I call it a
        = succeed "." do
          %span.strong
            ‘key bonding feature’
        Do you know what that key bonding feature was for your last scarf?
        Maybe it was something else like the material it is made of.
        Maybe it was bought from a new shop and you weren’t that sure about it when you bought it, but it turned out to be the best scarf ever.
        Either way, it’s important that you try to identify this much loved feature and that you at least match it in your next purchase.
        If you try to use this as your benchmark then anything else will turn out to be an added bonus.
        Your scarf is going to be there for you when you need it most.
        You will come to rely on it throughout winter, so it’s a good idea to find that key bonding feature right from the start.
        If you don't bond with your new scarf early on, then you won’t grow to rely on it once you have it at home.
        You might not wear it so often and this will turn out to be nothing more than a waste of your time and your money.
        So take a moment and think about what makes a scarf really great for you.

      %h3
        2. Materials: understanding what you need

      %p
        Materials is probably the most important feature of any of the best winter scarves.
        It doesn’t matter if it’s an affordable winter scarf or a designer one. Material counts.
        So, it is important to know the key groups.
        Do you know what materials you like best?
        Do you know what materials are the best ones for scarves and which ones are not so great?
        To save you time, I have condensed the variety of options into three straightforward and easy to digest groups.
        Not only will this save you time but it will also make it easy to assess what material you are faced with when you are out looking to buy.
        These three groups are synthetic, natural fibre and mixed fibre.
        Synthetic and mixed fibres can last longer, if well cared for.
        They are supposed to need less maintenance as a general rule, but some do differ.
        Natural fibres may also need a bit more care and attention but can also last much longer if well cared for.
        Some natural fibres can also be a bit more expensive due to the costly treatment process and the amount of extra skill required to make it into a nice lovely scarf.
        So do check that you know what a scarf is really made of.

        3. Know what you like and what you don’t like
      
      %p
        Everyone has a different style and colour preference, so it is really up to you.
        However, knowing what you do like is as important as knowing what you don’t.
        I asked several people on the high street if they knew what their must-have feature was for a winter scarf.
        Most people had to stop and think for a minute before answering.
        So, it’s clear that a lot of people don’t always think about it.
        Some just hoped that what they were looking for would just appear and they would accidentally come across it purely by chance.
        Some even said that they just hoped that what they bought was what they wanted, but they were not really sure until they had worn it out a few times.
        So, why take the risk?
        A little thought can get you much closer to finding and buying a scarf that will suit you, your preferences and your budget all in one.
        If I asked you what your favourite features of a scarf are, would you be able to say right away?
        Well to help you out I have added some of the top features that people said they wanted in a good winter scarf.
        Take a look and give it some thought.

        4. Care and maintenance: do you know how to care for a soft winter scarf?             

      %p
        Most people offer their winter scarf almost no care at all.
        At best, a scarf usually gets hung up behind a pile of coats, shoved in a cupboard or thrown on a shelf in the hall somewhere and that’s about it.
        But we do expect a great deal of service from our scarves.
        So why don’t we ever reciprocate with a little care and attention?
        Have you ever taken a little extra care of your winter scarf?
        Do you remember ever doing that?
        Nine times out of ten, the most we offer is a quick check to make sure it is clean and presentable on the way out the door and nothing more.
        If you are going to go to all the trouble of searching for and buying a quality scarf that you expect to last and keep you warm and comfortable then maybe it's time to rethink how you treat your new scarf once you have bought it.
        Most scarves do have a care label, but how many times have you ever read one?
        It’s time to start taking better care of your scarf.

      %h4
        Storing a scarf

      %p
        We all love to keep out clothes looking as good as possible and like new, but how about your scarf?
        How do you store your scarf when you are not wearing it?
        Do you hang it up by then neck area until the next time you need it?
        Do you think this is the best way to store your scarf?
        I don’t think it is.
        It can weigh it down and stretch the thickness of the neck area making it thinner.
        I like to keep this area as thick and cozy as possible to retain that snug feeling when I put it on.
        So, think about how you store your scarf when you are not wearing it.
        It may be causing it any damage and premature aging?
        Bad storage can shorten its life and ensure it ends up looking tatty in no time at all.

      %h4
        Wearing it with care

      %p
        It’s not only how you store a scarf that affects how long it lasts, but also how you wear it.
        Taking a little care to apply your scarf to your neck can also help enormously.
        Have you ever thought about how you wear your scarf?
        Do you know if you are gentle with it or if you vigorously wrap your scarf around you like a tightly coiled spring?
        It's worth taking a minute to think about this now, so when you find your new winter scarf you take good care of how you wear it.
        Do this and it will continue to take good care of you.

      %p
        Quality and budget are going to be your key deciding factors in finding your perfect winter scarf.
        When you are finally ready to make that purchase, does it include it being at the right price for you?
        So, how do you get the best quality you can, at the best price for you?
        Do you remember the deciding factors when you bought your last scarf?
        Was the fabric and the quality at the top of your list?
        Did you spend more than you usually like to?
        Was it worth it in the end or did it fall out of favour after a few trips out?
        Getting the price and quality right can be the difference between bonding with your scarf the moment you first wear it versus knowing you made a bad purchase from the start.
        Branding can play a key factor in this.
        If you know and regularly use a brand already and are happy with their pricing, then it would make sense to see what they have available.
        But, if you are testing your brand loyalty and looking a little further afield then start with the following guide on caution.

      %p
        My first piece of advice would be to avoid buying a trendy scarf from any top-end retailer until you are more comfortable with their pricing, quality, and longevity.
        Buying high ticket items from high end stores that you don’t usually shop at is usually where most people go wrong.
        My second piece of advice is to test a new brand out with a low ticket item.
        See if it fits in with your wardrobe and and will last with your current style.
        Another thing to look out for is your longevity expectations versus your budget.
        A high ticket trendy item might only last a short season and if it goes off trend quickly it might not be the right product for you and your budget.
        So, don't be under cautious.

      %p
        Choose wisely and for the long game and  be 100% sure before you commit to spending your money.
