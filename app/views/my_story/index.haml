      Welcome to Never Been Worn – where we like to live with better purpose

      %p
        My name is Rabena and like to live my life with purpose.
        I wake up every day and know that I am exactly where I want to be and I am doing exactly what I want to be doing.

      %p
        How did I get to this point? By living with better purpose.
        This is what Never Been Worn is all about.

      %h2
        A better life

      %p
        Just like your life, your wardrobe can be full of things that aren’t really working for you.
        It can be full of things you once bought that you thought were a great idea, then turned out not to be.

      %p
        That’s okay, but let me ask you a few questions.

      %p
        Did you hold on to those things in your wardrobe, hoping you would need them one day?
        Did that day ever come?
        Or are they still sat in your wardrobe hanging about, still waiting?

      %p
        If they are then what you have is a wardrobe full of clothes that you don’t wear, that you don’t need and that you bought for the wrong reason,
        but you are still holding on to them.
        Why?
        Maybe you feel you can’t get rid of them because you spent good money on them. 

      %p
        All those items in your wardrobe are really doing is taking up time in your life and space in your wardrobe.
        If your wardrobe is always occupied with things you don’t need and you don’t wear then so is your life.
        They are now a permanent thing in your life.
        You will see them every time you open your wardrobe.
        You will see them every time you are looking for something to wear.
        Being surrounded by things that you don’t use or need is like being stuck.
        This is no way to live.

      %h2
        This website is not just about clothes

      %p
        Part of my purpose in life is to try help others to live with their own greater purpose.
        Helping guide people to a life that really suits them better is why I am here.
        If you feel it’s time to change your perspective on your life.
        If you feel like it’s time to take hold of your purpose and really guide it forward again.
        If you feel like it’s time to really drive your own direction more, then it’s time to live with greater purpose. 

      %p
        So let’s do something about that.
        Why?
        Because it can save you time and if you can make a change in your wardrobe, you can make a change in other things in your life.
        How do know this?
        Because this is exactly what I did.
        I didn’t stop there though.
        Because of this I also spend less time doing laundry now.
        Actually I spend 80% less time doing laundry and I love it. 

      %h2
        How I started

      %p
        At a very young age my mum caught me organising the pans in one of our many kitchen cupboards.
        The pans were all around me on the floor at this point so it looked a bit of a mess but she calmly asked me what I was doing.
        My reply went something like this: “I am organising all the pans by how big they are and how often we use them, of course.”

      %p
        Well that seems quite straightforward, but this is what happened next.
        It became clear that we had too many pans.
        We even had pans we never used.
        Those extra pans – they had no purpose and they were always taking up space and getting in the way.
        It took longer to find the pan you wanted because of them.
        We didn’t throw them away though.
        We found them a new home and gave them better purpose.

      %h2
        How you can get started

      %h3
        Step 1

      %p
        You can start striving for better purpose right away, by going through your wardrobe and taking out all the items you had never worn or hardly ever worn.
        Just like I did. I have even created a
        =link_to('wardrobe challenge', article_path(id='the_wardrobe_challenge'))
        in case you are not sure how to get started.
        It will help you get rid of all the things you no longer need and bring you more focus and better purpose much quicker.

      %h3
        Step 2 - Repurposing

      %p
        Finding purpose and repurposing go hand in hand. 
        If you have clothes sat in your wardrobe that you have never worn, then sell them.
        People will buy them.
        If you want some cash back from the money you spent on unworn clothes, then sell them.
        If you want to start living with better purpose in your life, then take this first step and sell them.

      %h3
        Step 2 – My 1-2-3 guide
      
      %p
        If you are really ready to live with better purpose there is a full
        =link_to('1-2-3 step guide', "/#quick-guide")
        on my homepage.
        This will help you to clear out your
        =succeed "," do
          =link_to('wardrobe', article_path(id='the_wardrobe_challenge'))
        your
        =succeed "," do
          =link_to('drawers', article_path(id='fix_your_drawers_forever'))
        and your
        =link_to('shelves', article_path(id='get_your_messy_shelves_in_shape'))
        too.

      %h2
        My new life

      %p
        I have repurposed everything I didn’t need in my wardrobe.

      %p
        It takes me minutes to get ready in the morning because I only choose from things I already know that I will wear.
        It saves me so much time and I use that time to strive for great purpose in my life.
        It helps me achieve my goals and do meaningful things that I want to do, like less laundry and more travel,
        but it all started with my wardrobe and making it have better purpose in my life for me.

      %p
        I found my purpose, it’s right here.
        Now let’s find yours.
