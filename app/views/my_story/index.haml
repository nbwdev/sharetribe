      The wardrobe nightmare

        My wardrobe has always been a mess.
      %p
        The rail was literally full from one end to the other and it would take me far too long to find something to wear, but then when I tried to put anything back, that was even worse. It always turned into a big battle because there were no gaps anywhere. Sometimes I would open up both doors and stand there staring in at all the mess. Occasionally, I would even think about sorting it out, but usually I would just stare in at the enormity of my hoard. Then after about a minute I would be completely overwhelmed and shut the doors quickly.
      %p
        This became my never ending wardrobe nightmare.

        Like most things that are often avoided, eventually there does come a point of no return and one day I opened one of my wardrobe doors, because then I only saw half the mess. Well, on this day there was something different going on in there. There was a gap at one end of the rail. I didn’t notice it right away as I was too busy wondering what to wear and just expected to see the usual mess, but when it eventually caught my eye I just stared at it. To this day I am not totally sure that my brain was accepting the site of a gap in my cluttered wardrobe and I almost blanked it completely, But for just one second I have a lovely feeling. Did I have space in my wardrobe? Had the tidy fairies finally paid me a visit? Maybe my mess wasn’t so messy after all, But all I did was I grab what I was looking for and shut the door behind me, without another thought to that gap.

        The very next day the gap was much worse and again I refused to believe it was there at all. However, day three was a completely different matter. My wardrobe looked a funny shape. It was somehow wider at the bottom than it was at the top and now the doors didn’t quite meet. On this day I decided to investigate further. Opening both wardrobe doors I came face to face with the problem. There had been no visit from the tidy fairies in the night and it wasn’t down to me turning into an overnight tidy queen. I was still the owner of my own sad mess. The mysterious gap was down to one thing only. My wardrobe rail had now started to bend. The bend started right in the middle and went almost all the way along and that was that. Now I really had a problem. I would absolutely have to do something and it and I would have to be very soon.

        The thought of my wardrobe caving in was quite terrifying really and it could happen at any time. I had no idea how long it would hold. I also had no idea how to fix it. What I needed was a cup of tea and a nice sit down to come up with a plan.  I needed something that was not going to be too painful for me and that I could easily manage. I sat there sipping tea for a while feeling utterly overwhelmed.

      A new life and a new beginning

        Fast forward to today and I now have an amazing wardrobe and it looks just great too.
      %p
        It works for me and not against me. It is  well organized and not nearly so full. I am not even afraid to open both doors at once. I have all the clothes I need and I can find whatever I am looking for in less time too, but most of all I make less mess doing it. I can see gaps in there too, so there is no battle to put anything away anymore.

        My new wardrobe looks lovely, my rail remains straight and I am never want to go back to that old wardrobe mess again.
        I took on my wardrobe and I won. I am not going to lie it was such a big challenge but I did it!

        There was one last thing that really needed some urgent attention. I had all these clothes that I no longer needed. Most of them I had never even worn and I didn’t even realise I had so many. Now that I could see them all, I knew I definitely didn’t need them and there was no way that I was putting them back in my lovely tidy wardrobe.
      %p.old-version
        So what should I do with them all? Many people suggested selling them online as worn items, but that just didn’t seem right. These were good clothes, almost brand new and I had looked after them all that time so they still looked great. I wanted to find somewhere to sell them that would appreciate the good condition they were still in.

        This is how neverbeenworn was born.
