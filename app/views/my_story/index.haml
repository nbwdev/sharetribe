      %p
        My name is Rabena and I like to live my life with great purpose.
        I like to wake up and know that I am exactly where I want to be and I am doing exactly what I want to be doing.

      %p
        How did I get to this point?
        By living with greater purpose.
        This is what NeverBeenWorn is all about.

        How to get a better life

      %p
        Let’s take the first step.
        Just like your life, your wardrobe can be full of things that aren’t really working for you.
        It can be full of things you thought were a great idea and so you went ahead and bought them.
        Did they turn out to be as great as you imagined?
        Did they give you that uplift in life that you expected?
        If not, then they are no longer giving you greater purpose and they no longer have any true purpose in your life.

      %p
        Have you ever stopped to wonder why you are still holding on to them?
        Maybe you think that it’s okay to do that, but let me ask you a few questions.

      %p
        Why are you really holding on to these things in your wardrobe?
        Did you hope that one day they would turn into being useful? Did that day ever come?
        Or are they still sat in your wardrobe doing nothing, are they still taking up space in your life whilst you are still waiting for them to become useful?

      %p
        If this sounds like you then you probably have a wardrobe filled with clothes that you don’t wear, that you don’t need and that you bought for the wrong reason.
        They have now become a permanent unused thing in your life.
        Do you see them every time you open your wardrobe?
        Do you see them every time you are looking for something useful to wear?
        Being surrounded by these things all the time that you don’t wear or that you don’t use is like being stuck with a problem for life and this is no way to live your life.

      %p
        Maybe you feel like you have to hold onto them because you spent your money on them and maybe if you keep them it doesn't feel wasted?
        Maybe they don’t fit, or maybe you no longer like them as much, it doesn’t matter.
        All these items are really doing is holding you back, taking up time in your life and space in your wardrobe.
        But there is another way.
        It’s time to let them go and move on to better things.

      %h2
        This website is not just about clothes

      %p
        Part of my purpose in life is to help others to live with their own greater purpose.
        This is why I am here.
        Helping to guide people to a life that suits them much better.
        If the wardrobe in your life is filled with things you don’t want, you don’t wear and that have no real purpose in your life,
        then it is full of all the wrong things.
        It should be filled with things you really need in your life and things you wear all the time. 

      %p.strong
        Ask yourself the following questions:

      %ul
        %li
          Do you feel like it’s time to take hold of your purpose again?
        %li
          Do you feel like it’s time to move forward again?
        %li
          Do you feel like it’s time to drive your own direction again?
        %li
          Then it’s time to live with your own greater purpose.

      %p.strong
        So let’s do something about that. 

      %p
        Why?
        Because it can free you and give you back great purpose.
        How?
        If you can make a change in your wardrobe, you can make a change in other things in your life too.
        How do I know this?
        Because I already did that.
        I am free of things that don’t work for me, I am free of things that have no real purpose in my life.
        I am living with better direction and greater purpose and you can too. 

      %h2
        How I started

      %p
        Let me explain how it all started.
        At a very young age my mum caught me organising the pans in one of our many kitchen cupboards.
        The pans were all around me on the floor at this point, and so she angrily asked me what I was doing.
        My reply went something like this: “I am organising all the pans by how big they are and how much we use them, of course.”

      %p
        Well that seems quite straightforward, but guess what happened next.
        It became clear to me that we had too many pans.
        It was obvious to see, right there.
        We had pans of all sizes.
        We even had pans we never used.
        Those extra pans – they had no purpose.
        They were always there and they were always taking up space, and making it difficult to find the right pan, and always making a mess.
        It took much longer to find the only pan you really wanted because of all of them.
        In a situation like this would it not be better to remove all the unwanted or unused pans?
        Would it not be better to find them a new home?
        Would it not be better to finally be free of them so you can find what you need quicker and save time?

      %h2
        How can you live with better purpose?

      %h3
        Step 1 – How you can get started

      %p
        You can start striving for better purpose right away, by going through your wardrobe and taking out all the items you had never worn or hardly ever worn.
        Just like I did.
        I have even created a
        =link_to('wardrobe challenge', article_path(id='the_wardrobe_challenge'))
        in case you are not sure how to get started.
        It will help you get rid of all the things you no longer need or wear.
        It will help you focus and get ready quicker and this is how greater purpose begins.

      %h3
        Step 2 – Repurposing

      %p
        Finding purpose and repurposing go hand in hand at neverbeenworn. 
        If you have clothes sat in your wardrobe that you have never worn, then sell them.
        People want to support the re-purposing of clothes right now and they will buy them.
        I have cleared out my wardrobe already and sold everything I hadn’t worn.
        I have repurposed everything.
        It felt good and now I am free to live with my own greater purpose and less clutter.

      %h3
        Step 3 – My 1-2-3 guide
      
      %p
        If you really want to start living with much greater purpose now there is a
        =link_to('1-2-3 step guide', "/#quick-guide")
        on my homepage.
        Not only will it help you to
        =succeed "," do
          =link_to('clear out your wardrobe with the wardrobe challenge', article_path(id='the_wardrobe_challenge'))
        but also your
        =succeed "," do
          =link_to('drawers', article_path(id='fix_your_drawers_forever'))
        and your
        =link_to('shelves', article_path(id='get_your_messy_shelves_in_shape'))
        too.
        It's the same path I took, and it worked for me much faster.

      %h2
        My new life – more time and greater purpose

      %p
        I have already repurposed everything in my wardrobe that I know I didn’t need.
        It now takes me a few minutes to get ready in the morning just because of that one thing I did with my wardrobe.
        I get ready much quicker because I only choose from things I know I already wear and I use that extra time for myself and other things.
        I can use my extra time to strive for even greater purpose in life.
        It helps me achieve more goals daily and do more meaningful things.
        I also do less laundry, fewer chores, and more travel,
        but it all started with my wardrobe and making it have better purpose in my life.
        You can now have that too.
        Take my wardrobe challenge and start your better life today.
