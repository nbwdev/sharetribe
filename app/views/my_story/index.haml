      Welcome to Never Been Worn – where we like to live with better purpose

    .my-story-text
      %p
        My name is Rabena and I like to live my life well.
        I like to wake up and know that I am exactly where I want to be and I am doing exactly what I want to be doing.

      %p
        How did I get to this point?
        By living with great purpose.
        This is what NeverBeenWorn is all about.

      %h2
        How it All started

      %p
        Let me explain how it all started.
        At a very young age my mum caught me organising the pans in one of our many kitchen cupboards.
        The pans were all around me on the floor at this point, so she angrily asked me what I was doing.
        My reply went something like this: “I am organising all the pans by how big they are and how much we use them, of course.”

      %p
        It all sounds quite straightforward, right?
        But guess what happened next.
        It became clear to me that we just had too many pans.
        It was obvious to see.
        We had pans of all sizes, we had old pans, and we had pans we never used.
        They all took up too much space and made it difficult to find the one pan you really needed, and it was always a mess.
        All those extra pans - they had no purpose but we kept them for years.
        Why?
        We all fill our lives like this every day.

        Taking your first steps to a better life

      %p
        Part of my purpose in life is to help others to live with their own great purpose.
        This is why I am here.
        Helping to guide people to make better choices, build a better wardrobe and a better life that works for them and suits them much, much better.
        If you feel like your life is filled with things that are not really working for you then start with your wardrobe.
        So let’s do something about that.

      %p.strong
        Ask yourself the following questions:

      %ul
        %li
          Do you feel like it’s time to take hold of your purpose again?
        %li
          Do you feel like it’s time to move forward again?
        %li
          Do you feel like it’s time to drive your own direction again?
        %li
          Then it’s time to live with your own greater purpose.

      %p.strong
        So let’s do something about that. 

      %p
        %span.strong
          Why?
        If you can make a change in your wardrobe, you can make a change in the rest of your life too.
        How do I know this?
        Because
        %span.strong
          I already did it.
        I am free of things that don’t work for me, I am free of many things that have no real purpose in my life.
        I am already living with great purpose, and it all started with my wardrobe.

        How to get started with my 1-2-3 guide
      
      %p
        If you want to start living with much greater purpose there is a full
        =link_to('1-2-3 step guide', "/#quick-guide")
        on my homepage.

      %p
        Step 1 - my 
        =link_to('wardrobe challenge', article_path(id='the_wardrobe_challenge'))
        will help you get started.
        
      %p
        Step 2 and 3 are for your
        =link_to('drawers', article_path(id='fix_your_drawers_forever'))
        and
        =succeed "." do
          =link_to('shelves', article_path(id='get_your_messy_shelves_in_shape'))
        
      %p
        It's the same path I took, and it really works.

      %h2
        My new life – more time and greater purpose

      %p
        I have repurposed everything in my wardrobe that I know I no longer need.
        I have put it all back into the world for others to use.
        Now it takes me minutes to get ready every morning, just because of that one thing I did.
        So what did I do with all that extra time?
        I built this website. 

        I achieve my goals.
        I do less laundry and fewer chores, and I travel a lot more,
        but it all started with me fixing my wardrobe and making it work for me. This gave it better purpose in my life.
        You can have that too.
        Start your better life and better living now.
