    %h3 A change of season
    %p
      As neverbeenworn goes into its first autumn, we are taking a quick moment to reflect on how far we have come.
      We are proud to be here today and you are part of that journey too.
      So, we want to thank all you lovely ladies that have joined and come to support neverbeenworn on the journey so far.
      There is further to go and much to do, but for now we are simply enjoying the delights of the journey.
      There will always be things in life to deal with, and there will always be testing times along the way.
      We hope you will find more than clothes to resell and buy at neverbeenworn,
      we hope you will find somewhere to belong and somewhere to connect when the world feels a bit upside down.
      We hope you will find a good community to be part of along the way. We are grateful you are here with us. 

    %h3 Reflecting on the year so far
    %p
      As we go into autumn and feel the changes of the season upon us,
      we reach for comfort and warmth around us and in what we wear.
      The crisp fresh air and deep warm colours can encourage a little reflection on the time that has passed.
      Remind yourself how far you have come this year and that you have done well.
      Life is not always perfect and if something didn’t go quite right or just how you planned,
      let it be a time to be kind to yourself and a reminder yourself that you are strong and resilient.

    %h3 Looking forward in autumn
    %p
      Autumn brings the comfort of accessories as we reach for soft scarves,
      warm hats and good gloves to keep us warm in the fresh crisp air.
      So, about this time of year I like to have a good rummage through my autumn accessories and see what I have and I will need.
      Only this year I will looking much more closely at what I have and what I will wear.
      This year I want to really support sustainability.
      I will be looking for anything I have not managed to wear,
      so I can find it a new home and it can be enjoyed by someone else,
      and I will be looking for sustainable sources for anything I might need.
      If any of you are still new to the idea of sustainability in fashion then don’t fear,
      there are definitely more and more opportunities for us to make more sustainable choices in fashion without losing your sense of style.
      With your help it can become more a part of our daily lives.
      We can make sure that choosing sustainability in fashion becomes the easy choice and it becomes the good choice for the benefit of all animals, plants and humans in the world.
      It’s a choice that we really need to keep making to ensure that it sticks around now and for a long time in the future.
      Let’s make the right choices this autumn. Let’s make them together.
