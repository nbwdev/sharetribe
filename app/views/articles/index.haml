      %p
        As neverbeenworn goes into its first autumn, we are taking a quick moment to reflect on how far we have come.
        We are proud to be here today and you are part of that journey too.
        So, we want to thank all you lovely ladies that have joined and come to support neverbeenworn on the journey so far.
        There is further to go and much to do, but for now we are simply enjoying the delights of the journey.
        There will always be things in life to deal with, and there will always be testing times along the way.

      %h3 We want to help
      %p
        We all have clothes in our wardrobe that we just never got around to wearing and we simply no longer need.
        We know they take up too much room and we know we canâ€™t bring ourselves to get rid of them just yet.
        Why? Because these are great clothes and we still hope maybe we will wear them just once.
        The sad thing is, we know this might never happen, so we are stuck and there is no more room.
        Well great news ladies. We want to help you out with that. 

      %h3 Life is busy. How can we help?
      %p
        We want to help all you lovely ladies out there clear out your wardrobe and find a great new
